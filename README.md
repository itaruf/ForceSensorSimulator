<!-- How to run the project -->
### How to run the project:
  - Version: Unity (2021.3.37f1) LTS
  - Platform: Windows

There are 2 main scenes: Test_Setup and Test_Transition_Setup (in the _Scenes folder).

### Test_Setup
Contains the following relevant game objects:
  - 2 Force Sensor + Arrow: displays an arrow associated with a data sensor and representing the force data information provided by the external library.
  - 1 Arrow Settings Panel: UI where the force sensors/arrows' global settings (e.g: force threshold, color selection for low and high magnitude values, etc.) are centralized.
  - 1 Scene Settings Manager: from where we can call the YAML parser at editor time, or at run time.

That scene showcases the visual representation of the simulation of force information with arrows. Force sensors/arrows' parameters can be updated in-game through the UI or through the parsed data extracted by the YAML parser.

### Test_Transition_Setup
Contains the following relevant game object:
   - 1 Scene Settings Manager

An empty scene showcasing the YAML parser, i.e. the extraction of data from a YAML file, the addition of missing game objects and the adjustments of some of their properties (e.g: position, rotation, colors, parent, etc.), at editor time, or at run time.
